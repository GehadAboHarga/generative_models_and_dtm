# generative_models_and_dtm
this is a project for testing various text mining and machine learning technologies. it uses generative models and document word matrix

## Overview
Initail data source: "Trade News Today" emails
Reference of techniques and code:
     * [Document Clustering with Python](http://brandonrose.org/clustering) (orginal code was kept as original as possible).
     * Classification
     * Use unsuperized learning, clustering and topic model, to classify news articles into categories
     * Classified data could be used as traing data for classifiction models (different algritoms)
     * Classification model could be used classify news flow into categories
     * Topic model: use topic model to identify keywords, then use keywords to summarize new data
     * Sentiment analysis

## Dependencies

* nltk
* numpy

Download missing dependencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

## Usage

For the python code, set the file manually in the code to your local dataset then run `python LDA.py`
